# To-Do List: Information Aggregator with Web API and Scraping

## ‚úÖ Project Setup
#### **Assigned to:** `Nelkit`

- [x] Set up a new Python project.
- [x] Create a virtual environment.
- [x] Install required dependencies (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Matplotlib`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`).
- [x] Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) and initialize a repository.
- [x] Create a `README.md` file with project details.

## üì° News API Integration
#### **Assigned to:** `Person1, Person2`
- [ ] Research and choose a public news API (e.g., News API, Bing News Search API).
- [ ] Register for API access and obtain API keys.
- [ ] Implement API request functionality to fetch news articles.
- [ ] Allow users to filter by category or source.
- [ ] Parse and structure JSON/XML responses.

## üï∏Ô∏è Web Scraping
#### **Assigned to:** `Person1, Person2`
- [ ] Identify relevant news article pages to scrape.
- [ ] Use `BeautifulSoup` to extract missing details (e.g., content, author, date).
- [ ] Handle pagination and dynamic content loading if necessary.
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed requests.
- [ ] Respect robots.txt and ethical scraping guidelines.

## üîÑ Data Processing
#### **Assigned to:** `Person1, Person2`
- [ ] Merge API data with scraped data.
- [ ] Remove duplicates and clean up data inconsistencies.
- [ ] Format the dataset for further processing and visualization.

## üìä Data Visualization
#### **Assigned to:** `Person1, Person2`
- [ ] Select a visualization library (Matplotlib/Plotly).
- [ ] Implement visualizations (e.g., article distribution by source/category).
- [ ] Provide insights based on the aggregated data.

## üèóÔ∏è Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
#### **Assigned to:** `Person1, Person2`
- [ ] Define appropriate classes for data entities (e.g., `NewsArticle`, `NewsAggregator`).
- [ ] Implement modular and scalable architecture using OOP principles.
- [ ] Use encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Reliable and Tested Code with GUI 
#### **Assigned to:** `Nelkit`
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical functions (`unittest`).
- [ ] Ensure sufficient test coverage.
- [x] Design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using `Streamlit`.
- [x] Integrate data display and interaction in the GUI.

## ‚ö° Optional Features
#### **Assigned to:** `Person1, Person2`
- [ ] Allow users to specify the number of articles to fetch.
- [ ] Implement caching to reduce API requests and scraping load.

## üé• Video Presentation
#### **Assigned to:** `Person1, Person2`
- [ ] Plan the video outline:
  - Introduction (overview of the assignment).
  - Objectives (functionality, OOP, GUI, testing).
  - Key Components (API, scraping, OOP, GUI, testing, visualization).
  - Submission requirements and ethical considerations.
- [ ] Record a clear, concise video (5-6 min max).
- [ ] Include screen recordings and slides if needed.

## üìå Submission Requirements
- [ ] Ensure the Python codebase is well-documented.
- [ ] Include a `README.md` with instructions to run the program.
- [ ] Specify necessary API keys and dependencies.
- [ ] Write a brief report on challenges, design decisions, and additional features.
- [ ] Attach the video presentation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
- [ ] Follow ethical scraping practices and legal considerations.
- [ ] Ensure the project is modular, maintainable, and scalable.
- [ ] Test thoroughly before submission.
