# Group Project Assignment: Information Aggregator with Web API and Scraping

## Python üêç Programming Subject

## Description  
This project challenges you to build an Information Aggregator using Web APIs and Web Scraping techniques. It emphasizes the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) and the implementation of unit testing to ensure a modular and reliable codebase. Additionally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is required to enhance user interaction and usability.
