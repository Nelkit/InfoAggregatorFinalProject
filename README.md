# Group Project Assignment: Information Aggregator with Web API and Scraping

#### Due 16 May by 23:59 (Points 40)
This assignment aims to challenge you to develop a Python program that functions as an Information Aggregator using web APIs and web scraping techniques. This assignment encourages the integration of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and the implementation of unit testing for a robust, maintainable codebase. Another important point of this assignment lies in the inclusion of a graphical user interface (GUI), transforming your creation into a user-friendly and interactive tool.

## Submission Requirements:

Submit a well-documented Python codebase.
Include a README file explaining how to run the program, any necessary API keys, and dependencies.
Provide a brief report discussing challenges faced, design decisions, and any additional features implemented beyond the basic requirements.
