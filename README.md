## Python üêç Programming Subject

## Description
This assignment aims to challenge you to develop a Python program that functions as an Information Aggregator using web APIs and web scraping techniques. This assignment encourages the integration of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and the implementation of unit testing for a robust, maintainable codebase. Another important point of this assignment lies in the inclusion of a graphical user interface (GUI), transforming your creation into a user-friendly and interactive tool.
